👋 Hey, I'm Anna Mettifogo  

Born and raised in Italy 🇮🇹 — though half French 🇫🇷 — I’ve always loved exploring how things work behind the scenes.  

🎓 I study **Computer Science and Engineering** at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), finishing my [Bachelor’s](https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-programmes/programme-detail/engineering-of-computing-systems) while starting my **[Master’s**](https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-magistrale-programmes/programme-detail/computer-science-and-engineering) (English track).  

💡 I’m passionate about **UI/UX design**, **graphics**, and how visual choices shape perception.  
Recently, I’ve also developed a strong curiosity for **cybersecurity**, which I plan to explore further during my Master’s.  

🥋 Outside the academic world, I’m a **black belt in karate** with over 10 years of practice, and I love sports of every kind — from **running** and **swimming** to **mountain hiking**. 
I’m currently training for a **half marathon**, aiming one day for a **full marathon** and an **Ironman**.
