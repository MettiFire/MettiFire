# 👋🏼 Hi, I'm Anna Mettifogo  

Born and raised in [Brescia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brescia)🇮🇹, I’ve always loved exploring how things work behind the scenes.  

🎓 I’m studying **Computer Science and Engineering** at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/), currently completing my [Bachelor’s in Engineering of Computing Systems
](https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-programmes/programme-detail/engineering-of-computing-systems) and starting my [Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.polimi.it/en/education/laurea-magistrale-programmes/programme-detail/computer-science-and-engineering) *(English track)*.  

🎨 I’m passionate about **UI/UX design**, **graphics**, and how visual choices shape perception.  
Recently, I’ve also developed a strong curiosity for **cybersecurity**, which I plan to explore further during my Master’s.  

🥋 When I'm not deep in books or in front of my computer, I'm 99% doing sports: I’m a **black belt in karate** with over 10 years of practice, and I love the discipline, focus, and strength it brings.  

🏃🏻‍♀️ I love sports of every kind — from **running** and **swimming** to **mountain hiking**. I’m currently training for a **half marathon**, aiming one day for a **full marathon** and an [Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon).
