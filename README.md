# Hi, I'm Anna!

Born and raised in Italy 🇮🇹 I’ve always loved **understanding how things work behind the scenes**.  
Curiosity and creativity drive most of what I do.

🎓 I live in **Brescia** and study **Computer Science and Engineering** at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).  
I’m finishing my **Bachelor’s degree** while starting my **Master’s in Computer Science Engineering (🇬🇧)** — diving deeper into the fields I’m most passionate about.

💡 Over the past few years, I’ve become especially interested in **UI/UX design** — how to make information not only clear but visually engaging.  
I love exploring how **graphics and design choices influence human perception**.  
Thanks to a course I took last year, I also discovered a growing curiosity for **cybersecurity**, something I plan to explore further during my Master’s, now that I have more flexibility in course selection.

### 🥋 Outside the academic bubble
Sports have always been a huge part of my life.  
I’m a **black belt in karate** with over 10 years of practice, and I love the discipline, focus, and strength it brings.  
I’m currently training for a **half marathon**, with the long-term goals of running a **full marathon** and eventually completing an **Ironman**.  

When I’m not training, you’ll probably find me:
- 📚 reading (I’m a big fan of books that inspire growth and reflection)
- 🏔️ hiking in the mountains
- 💻 tinkering with side projects or experimenting with new design ideas

### 🌱 Always learning
I’m fascinated by the intersection between **technology, design, and human behavior** —  
and I’m always looking for ways to turn curiosity into something tangible.
